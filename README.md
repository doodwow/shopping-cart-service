### Requirements
* Java 1.8
* Maven 3.3.1 or higher
  * We use [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/takari-maven-plugin) to ensure projects can have their own versions of Maven and not rely on the operating system

### Build

Use Maven to install dependencies and build the artifact:
```
./mvnw clean package
```

## Run

Run the application locally:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

View the application here: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
